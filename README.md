# Django Security Demo App

A Django web application intentionally designed with security vulnerabilities.

User can register an account and leave comments. Only and admin or the author of the comment can delete comments. Admin can also see the users in an admin dashboard.

You can automatically add users on the frontpage (note that this will also remove the existing users and comments).
